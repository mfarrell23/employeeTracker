# employeeTracker
This project was inspired by having the abiliy to add new employees at a database.
This project takes info from 3 data tables and combines them into one database.
## General Info
This project takes 3 tables and makes an employee database that uses the employee's name, salary, title, and department they work in.
This keeps things nice and easily read so you know who works where, and what their pay is.
## Installation
The user must install the node packages, to get json, and express. They then need to get mysql running to load the database with the schema. Once schema is up then the user needs to get the seeds.sql going to fill the database. Once these are up and running, then the user needs to make sure they have it open on their local host port, this will ensure that the database will accept new employees.
## Use
After the user installs all the necesary packages, the user may use the prompt to view employees, view roles, and or view departments. The user may also add a role, or employee, or department. The user may also update an existing employee. The tables will populate in the terminal in a table so the user can see who is doing what, and if they are a manager or not.
